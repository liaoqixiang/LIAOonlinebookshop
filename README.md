# LeoOnlineBookshop
Briefly Intro:
This web app is developed only by myself and takes me so long to build it(i have to stop it between March and October because of my final year of study at Auckland Uni).

The main goal is to show my skill in how to use Ado.Net to access data and data services from the database to achieve CURD, pagination(i still need to write high qulity Mssql so my Sql skill is also solid)

how to use session and cookie to achieve authentication and user state maintenance(cookie).

jquery is used to provide front-end validation and final back-end validation(no plugins(all delevoped by myself))

Also, i use jquery ajax to exchange data between client side and server side to improve user experience(i have 1 and half years of experience of using javascript and jquery)

All functionalites cannot be finished and achieved due to the large amount of work unless it can be done by a team.

Asp.Net webform bookshop
Technology:
1. DataBase: MSSQL
2. Access to Database FrameWork: Ado.Net(My second project use EF ORM)
3. Front-end: Jquery(to ajaxifyling my web App) and Bootstrap
4. BackEnd: c#.Net, Asp.Net WebForm, using Generic handler to deal with authentication and jquery ajax since i dont need to show anything, ashx is a more efficient way of implementing it accroding to Asp.Net Request Flow.
5. Not using any Controls in my project since original web development gives me more flexibility and expansibility.
6. Although webform aspx has tight coupling, it is much more convenient than Asp.Net MVC.
7. I also use static html page to store detail of books which can release a lot of server side pressure.

How to Use:
This is a web app selling books. so the main functionality is in bookshop part(as you can see in the nav bar.)

Account: you can register and sign in to add the books into your own shopping cart(anonymous user cannot have this access(it's more complex.))

BookShop:
1. you can view all books with pagination.
2. you can order the price of book ascending or descending.
3. you can choose category of books
4. you can go to the detail page of the book and comment it.
5. Simply clicking add to cart, you will be able to add it into your shopping cart and view it in cart(nav bar).
6. you can modify the amount of books you want to buy and you will have the total cost of books.
7. you can pay as well.
